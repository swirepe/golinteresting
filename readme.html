<p>Peter Swire - swirepe.com</p>
<p>This was a final project for <a href="http://users.wpi.edu/~josephbeck/">Professor Beck's</a> Artificial Intelligence class. I worked with Charles Davis, Xika Lin, and Paul Kehrer.</p>
<h2 id="about">About</h2>
<p>We chose to explore the game of life because it makes for pretty pictures, and machine learning is always better with pictures. We wanted to see if</p>
<p>A. we could classify &quot;interesting&quot; starting patterns in the game of life.</p>
<p>B. we could use that classifier to create new interesting patterns.</p>
<p>C. we could see what interesting patterns exist in the Game of Life played with other rules.</p>
<p>I don't know where the presentation or paper is, but this is the code repository from that project.</p>
<p>As an extra, the <a href="https://github.com/swirepe/gollocal">gollocal</a> project was used to search the space of all possible rules for interesting boards.</p>
<p>This project got an A.</p>
