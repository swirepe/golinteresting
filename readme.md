# Game of Life - Interesting Rules

Peter Swire - swirepe.com

This was a final project for [Professor Beck's](http://users.wpi.edu/~josephbeck/) Artificial Intelligence class.  I worked with Charles Davis, Xika Lin, and Paul Kehrer.

## About

We chose to explore the game of life because it makes for pretty pictures, and machine learning is always better with pictures.  We wanted to see if

A. we could classify "interesting" starting patterns in the game of life.

B. we could use that classifier to create new interesting patterns.

C. we could see what interesting patterns exist in the Game of Life played with other rules.

I don't know where the presentation or paper is, but this is the code repository from that project.

As an extra, the [gollocal](https://github.com/swirepe/gollocal) project was used to search the space of all possible rules for interesting boards.

This project got an A.
